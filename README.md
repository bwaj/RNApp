Let's build a web app to track music listening and report stats on top artists and songs. 

Help me think through how to break this into an iterative process and write a plan.md. 

Requirements: 
- google OAuth to log in, no username/password - ensure DB schema handles this. 
- Allow user to connect their Spotify music account, where they'll be listening to music. 
- Use the Spotify API to get back information about music usage to store in DB
- Add unit tests for business logic, e2e tests for core user journies. 
- use git and pnpm, use descriptive commits. 

Design: 
- minimal, functional and practical. 
- Intentional use of color. 
- Warmer tones. 
- Inspired by social apps. 

Frontend: 
- Next.js and React
- Tailwind CSS V4
- shadcn/ui
- ESLint 9

Backend: 
- Postgres
- Drizzle ORM

Infra: 
- GitHub
- Vercel
- Sentry

Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them as a todo list. If you have open questions that require my input, add those in the plan as well.
